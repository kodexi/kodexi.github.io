    <h1>Basics of Web</h1>
    <p>
        Internet is a large network of interconnected computers that communicate
        together. These computers are connected via a special computer called router
        which ensures that messages reach their intended destination. This can be
        extended via connecting routers to each other. And to connect between routers,
        we use Modems that connect out computers to these routers.
        Each connected computer (even router and server) has a unique IP address 
        that allows for targetted communication.
        Domain name is a human readable name so that we can remember it easily.
        google.com is the domain name of 142.250.190.78. To resolve these, we have  
        a special type of servers called DNS Server. Servers are designed 
        to provides services, data or resources to other computers.
        This is the basis of the Server - Client model, where the server hosts the website 
        and the client can view the website by requesting the server for it. Website is a 
        collection of web pages. In this case, the server is called Web Server. Web is a 
        service that sits on top of Internet just like other services like Email, Cloud 
        Storage, E-Commerce, etc...
        The data is not sent as a single big payload but as small packets which takes
        different routes to arrive at the destination where it's assembled back.
